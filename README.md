# Smart Notes Builder

Smart Notes Builder is a **local-first Flask application** that converts handwritten lecture notes into structured, searchable study notes using Google's Gemini AI models.

The application accepts one or more images of handwritten notes, extracts and organizes the content using Gemini, and generates well-formatted Microsoft Word (DOCX) documents for revision and long-term storage.
